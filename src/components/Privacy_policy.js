                  the data you input, to safeguard the security of Your Personal
                  information during transmission. It's crucial for You to keep
                  an eye on anyone who has access to Your password, computer,
                  laptop, or any other device through which Your account can be
                  accessed in order to avoid unauthorised access to critical
                  data. If you're using a shared computer, make sure you log off

                  the transfer of information, including Personal Information
                  shared by You, other than as specified in this Policy. This is
                  due to the nature of internet transactions. Any online
                  information transmission is done at your own risk, and we are
                  not liable if you or a third party circumvent privacy settings

                  When using our services, you grant Guide Junior access to Your
                  Personal Information. You can ask us to change or remove that
                  information if it's inaccurate. Guide Junior will do all within
                  its power to make sure that the Personal Information is
                  changed and used for providing services to You and in other
                  ways that are legal. Before we may act on your request to
                  amend or delete Personal Information, we may ask You to prove
                  your identity. Any request that is illegal or necessitates

                  to fulfil the Platform's service requirements or as mandated
                  by applicable Indian legislation. On occasion, we might also
                  need to give your personal information to third-party service
                  providers. For instance, to approve transactions, we might
                  give these providers access to your financial information. You

                  All such transfers are made by Guide Junior fully in compliance

                  freedom to use and disclose the Personal Information they
                  collect in accordance with their own privacy policies. Please
                  be aware that we have no control over the activities of other

                  personal information, and that any such acts are completely
                  your responsibility. <br /> <br />
